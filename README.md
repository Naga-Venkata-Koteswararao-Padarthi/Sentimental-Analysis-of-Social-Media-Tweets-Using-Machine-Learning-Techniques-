# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Social-Media-Tweets-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques-
This repository contains projec on Personality Prediction using Machine Learning, where I analyze textual data to predict Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits. The project involves text preprocessing, feature selection techniques and classification. The goal is to understand how language patterns can be used to infer personality traits effectively.
Predicting a user's personality from their digital footprints has become a computationally challenging problem due to the rapid increase in Internet users. The objective is to identify human personalities by gathering information from their tweets. I tried different machine learning algorithms and feature selection algorithms to find out the most suitable combinations of algorithms to predict personality.
In this work I used two datasets a test dataset with unprocessed textual statements and a training dataset with demographic information, Big Five scores, and personality labels. Tokenization, punctuation removal, stop word removal, and stemming were among the text preprocessing techniques used to transform unstructured text into useful features. The most informative characteristics were found using feature selection techniques such the Chi-Squared Test, Information Gain, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was trained to categorize personality labels after the OCEAN scores for the processed text were calculated.
From the experimental results, the model mapped language features psychological attributes and obtained promising accuracy on unseen data. The results show that machine learning can reliably extract significant personality insights from text. Applications including recommendation systems, targeted marketing, hiring screening, and mental health monitoring can all benefit from this strategy. Additionally, the work identifies areas that could be improved by utilizing deeper learning models and bigger datasets.
